### Logo & Brand Identity

![Avagen Logo](media/avagen_logo_text.webp)

The Avagen logo represents the brand's focus on digital identity creation. It is futuristic and colourful.  
The logo communicates that Avagen is a forward-thinking brand centered on empowering users to create unique digital personas.

## Colour Palette

![Colour Palette](media/colourpalette.webp)

The Avagen site uses a clean, minimal layout with a palette of soft neutral colours for backgrounds and sections. Bold, vibrant colors like blue (#007BFF), yellow (#FFC107), and raspberry (#D72660) are used for buttons and key actions, making them stand out and easy to find. This approach keeps the interface simple and readable while clearly guiding users to important features.
Typography is modern and easy to read, with Inter for body text and Space Grotesk for headings. The design stays consistent and clear on all screen sizes, creating a smooth and enjoyable user experience.

## Models 

### Custom Models 

The application includes five custom models across modular apps, each written manually custom models to address the needs of the user, site owner and online shopper:

1. ### `Review` Model
- Connected to `User` and `Product` via foreign keys.
- Stores `rating` (1–5 stars), `comment`, and a `created_on` timestamp.
- Prevents duplicate reviews per user/product using model-level constraints.
- Includes logic for calculating average product ratings.

2. ### `Catalogue` Models

The catalogue app is responsible for: 

- Associating **digital downloads** with products.
- Allowing **authenticated users** to access downloads after purchase or review.
- Enabling **admins** to upload downloadable content via Django Admin.

**DigitalDownload**

Stores downloadable files for each product.

**Fields:**
- `product`: ForeignKey to `Product`
- `file_url`: Link to file (links product files to secure Google Cloud Storage URLs).
- `uploaded_at`: Timestamp

- Download access is restricted to users who've completed a purchase.

3. ### `Newsletter Subscriber` Model
- Stores `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email` fields.
- Designed to work with external marketing tools like Mailchimp or SMTP.
- Built manually, allowing full control over form handling and integration.

```python
class Subscriber(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    subscribed_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

4. ### `FAQ` Model

The FAQ model is designed to store frequently asked questions along with their answers. 

- Question & Answer structure
- Optional user association (via `ForeignKey`)
- Auto timestamp for creation date
- Admin-friendly metadata (ordering, verbose names)

The model has two main fields:

- `question`: A `CharField` used to store the text of the question.  
  `max_length=255` restricts it to 255 characters.

- `answer`: A `TextField` for storing the full answer or explanation.  
  This allows long-form content.

 **Optional User Association**

```python
user = models.ForeignKey(
    settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
    on_delete=models.CASCADE,
    null=True,
    blank=True
)
```
5. ### `Product` Model
- Core model with `name`, `description`, `model_number`, `base_price`, and Cloudinary images.
- Displays a list of all available products.
- Includes a `slug` field for SEO-friendly URLs.
- `base_price` Contains methods for dynamic pricing that is incremental from the base price. Returns price for `Personal`, `Indie`, or `Professional` licenses.
- `is_live` controls products storefront visibility (draft or published).
- Cloudinary used for optimised media storage.

**Category**
- Self-referencing `parent` field for hierarchical structure.
- Supports nested categories for advanced product filtering.

**LicensePrice**
- Stores multipliers for Personal, Indie, and Professional licenses.
```
class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=120)
    slug = models.SlugField(unique=True)
    model_number = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    description = models.TextField()
    base_price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=8, decimal_places=2)
    image = CloudinaryField('image')
    is_live = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```
